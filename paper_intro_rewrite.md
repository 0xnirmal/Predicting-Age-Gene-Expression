# Paper Introduction Rewrite #



For my second paper that targets a specialized audience, I chose the [Inference of Population Structure Using Multilocus Genotype Data paper][2]. I rewrote the beginning of the introduction of the paper to broaden its focus towards the problem and lessen its focus on the biology or methods. 

Understanding population structures is important in identifying evolutionary processes over time and how people have migrated and mixed. Also, modeling population structures allows individuals of unknown origin to uncover their ancestry. Naturally, scientists have attempted to uncover these population structures by sampling DNA from a set of individuals and then estimating parameters about the underlying populations. Then, using these parameters, specifically allele frequencies at different loci, scientists can estimate the likelihood of new individuals of unknown origins to any of the populations. However, there are a number of challenges associated with building such a model and learning its parameters. First, defining the populations that the sequenced individuals come from is difficult. Population definition is generally subjective based on phsyical or cultural characteristics, but there is little proof of consistencies of these observations with genetic information. Second, individuals can come from more than one population (i.e. mixed), so a hard assignment of population when learning is impractical and inaccurate. We propose a Bayesian clustering approach to this problem that assumes little about the populations of the sampled individuals and learns the population parameters and the assignments of individuals probabilistically.
