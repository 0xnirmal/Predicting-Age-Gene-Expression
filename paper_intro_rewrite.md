# Paper Introduction Rewrite #

For my first paper that appears to target a broad rather than a specialized audience, I chose the [Modeling Clinical Time Series Using Gaussian Process Sequences paper][1]. The reason I felt this targets a broad audience is that it defines a problem, presents several current solutions in the field, and then synthesizes them into its own solution. In this way, the paper assumes no knowledge of the current solutions and reads like a textbook. I rewrote the beginning of the introduction with the idea that the reader is familar with linear dynamical systems and gaussian processes and simply need to learn how their new model solves the problems associated with clinical time series modeling.
